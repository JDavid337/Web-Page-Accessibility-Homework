# ADVANCED CSS PORTFOLIO HOMEWORK
This is my portfolio page. It is designed to showcase web pages that I have designed and created, utilizing my skills honed at the DU bootcamp.  It also provides a short biography about me, along with two recent photos of me, one indoor and one outdoor.  The info in my bio and my pictures is to try to suggest duality and allude to front end / back end development.  At the footer of my web page is my contact information, designed as links so employers can easily get in contact with me, view my work in GitHub, and see my work history in LinkedIn.

Beneath my initial photograph are three buttons designed to take the user to that section of the page that the buttons corralate with.  This is to provide seemless navigation throughout the page.  

While my first assignment web page is the only work that I am showcasing now, as at this point it is the only web page that I have created, I inted to add more projects as time goes on.
